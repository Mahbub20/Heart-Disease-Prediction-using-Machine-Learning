# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Globally, heart disease is one of the most alarming disease nowadays. According to recent
survey by WHO (World health organization) 17.9 million people die each year because
of heart related diseases and it is increasing rapidly[1].So, this sector seek the attention
of researchers to work with modern technology and tools for the early prediction of the
disease in order to save millions of lives.There are number of research papers also have
been done by using data mining and machine learning techniques[16].This paper analyzes
various Machine Learning techniques namely Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classification,
Decision tree and Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression by
using a qualified data set for Heart disease prediction.The main aim of this research paper
includes finding the performances of these six different machine learning techniques and
comparing their accuracies to find which perform better for prediction of the heart dis-
ease.The testing result showed that Support Vector Machine and Random Forest achieved
model accuracies of 87.91%.
